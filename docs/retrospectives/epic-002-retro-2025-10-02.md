## PART 1: EPIC 002 REVIEW DISCUSSION

### Sarah (Product Owner)

**What Went Well:**
- All 4 stories delivered to "Ready for Review" status with comprehensive AC validation
- Ragas integration successfully adds quality awareness layer to demo - differentiates from basic "ChatGPT wrapper"
- Senior Developer Review process identified medium-priority gaps early (Story 2.2 placeholder scores)
- All stories maintain performance constraints (<5s response time with Ragas overhead)
- Query logging infrastructure enables future comparative analysis and improvement tracking

**What Could Improve:**
- Story 2.2 initially had placeholder implementation (hardcoded 0.0 scores) - needed clarification on MVP vs complete implementation
- Multiple review cycles for some stories (2.1 had minor recommendations, 2.2 required changes, 2.3 accessibility findings)
- Cross-story coordination lighter than Epic 1 but still required careful tracking of ragas_scores field across backend/frontend

**Lessons Learned:**
- Graceful degradation pattern from Epic 1 carried forward excellently - Ragas failures never block query flow
- Acceptance criteria need explicit "real implementation" vs "infrastructure only" distinctions to avoid placeholder code
- Color-coding thresholds (green >0.8, yellow 0.7-0.8, red <0.7) should have been validated with actual Ragas score distributions earlier

---

### Bob (Scrum Master)

**What Went Well:**
- Zero blocked stories - all dependencies from Epic 1 were ready (query pipeline, database, LLM integration)
- Consistent test discipline maintained - every story has comprehensive test coverage before review
- Integration pattern clear - Ragas called AFTER SQL execution, extends existing flow cleanly
- Team velocity maintained despite new framework (Ragas) learning curve

**What Could Improve:**
- Story 2.2 v1.0 delivered with placeholder scores - definition of "done" needed clarification upfront
- Some stories had accessibility gaps discovered in review (Story 2.3 missing ARIA labels, PropTypes)
- Technical dependencies not fully explored in preparation sprint - Ragas dataset format requirements discovered during implementation

**Lessons Learned:**
- The "infrastructure first, implementation second" approach worked for Story 2.1/2.2 but created ambiguity about completion criteria
- Dev Agent Record quality excellent in Story 2.4 (detailed root cause analysis) - consistent pattern from Epic 1
- Ragas framework integration simpler than anticipated - graceful fallback pattern from Epic 1 reused successfully

---

### Amelia (Developer Agent)

**What Went Well:**
- Ragas service module follows established Epic 1 patterns - consistent with llm_service, validation_service structure
- Graceful degradation implemented perfectly - `RAGAS_AVAILABLE` flag, try/except blocks, returns None on failure
- QueryResponse model extension clean - added ragas_scores field without breaking existing API contract
- Frontend RagasScoreDisplay component simple and effective - pure functional component, proper null handling
- Test coverage excellent across all stories (4 tests Story 2.1, 21 tests Story 2.2, 11 tests Story 2.3, 24 tests Story 2.4)

**What Could Improve:**
- Story 2.2 v1.0 used placeholder scores - should have clarified "real Ragas calls" requirement upfront
- Type hints inconsistent (Story 2.1 low-priority finding, Story 2.2 medium finding about `Dict[str, float] | None`)
- PropTypes and ARIA labels missing in Story 2.3 - accessibility should be built-in, not review finding
- SQLAlchemy declarative_base deprecation warning persists from Epic 1 - still not addressed

**Lessons Learned:**
- Ragas Dataset.from_dict format requires specific structure (question/answer/contexts) - discovered during Story 2.2 v2.0 implementation
- Real Ragas metric calculation adds meaningful overhead (500-850ms) but stays within <5s budget
- React component patterns from Epic 1 (functional, early return, TailwindCSS) reused successfully
- Query logging with graceful error handling prevents database failures from blocking queries

---

### Murat (Master Test Architect)

**What Went Well:**
- Test coverage trajectory maintained - 4 tests (2.1) → 21 tests (2.2) → 11 tests (2.3) → 24 tests (2.4) = 60 new tests
- Edge case coverage strong - null handling, score boundaries (0.7, 0.8), Decimal serialization, database errors
- Graceful degradation testing comprehensive - Story 2.2 tests verify query continues when Ragas unavailable/fails
- Performance validation included - response time <5s verified despite Ragas overhead
- Integration tests effective - Story 2.4 endpoint tests found gaps in error handling

**What Could Improve:**
- No load testing with real Ragas overhead - current tests mock Ragas, so actual 500-850ms target unverified under load
- Frontend accessibility testing minimal - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation not tested
- Some tests verify placeholder behavior (Story 2.2 v1.0 asserted 0.0 scores) - needed updating after real implementation
- Missing performance test for query logging overhead (<50ms target from tech spec)

**Lessons Learned:**
- E2E testing principle from Epic 1 remains supreme - Story 2.4 integration tests found response structure validation issues
- Mocking strategy appropriate for external libraries (Ragas) but masks real performance characteristics
- Test data intentionality matters - weak query test cases (scores <0.7) enable realistic recommendation testing
- AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) consistently applied across all Epic 2 tests

---

### Winston (Architect)

**What Went Well:**
- Service layer pattern maintained - ragas_service.py and report_service.py fit cleanly alongside Epic 1 services
- Database extension minimal - single query_logs table with proper indexes (created_at DESC, faithfulness_score)
- Frontend integration non-invasive - RagasScoreDisplay component adds below results without layout disruption
- Performance budget respected - Ragas overhead 500-850ms keeps total response <5s (NFR002)
- Graceful degradation architecture from Epic 1 extended perfectly to evaluation layer

**What Could Improve:**
- Migration pattern established in Epic 1 followed (003_create_query_logs_table.py) but no migration testing automation
- Ragas dataset format requirements not fully documented upfront - discovered during Story 2.2 implementation
- Query logging error handling defensive but database failures not fully tested (connection pool exhaustion scenarios)
- No caching strategy for identical queries - re-evaluation overhead could be optimized

**Lessons Learned:**
- Async/await pattern from Epic 1 works seamlessly with Ragas integration - no blocking calls
- Pydantic model composition (extending QueryResponse) cleaner than inheritance for optional fields
- Ragas runs in-process (no new external service) - simplifies deployment and reduces failure modes
- Recommendation engine pattern-based (Story 2.4) scales better than ML-based for demo scope

---

### Mary (Business Analyst)

**What Went Well:**
- Requirements traceability maintained - every AC cites tech-spec-epic-2.md with precision
- Evaluation metrics aligned with demo value proposition - shows quality awareness to interview panel
- Color-coding thresholds (green/yellow/red) intuitive for users - no training required
- Recommendation engine actionable - identifies salary queries, faithfulness issues, precision problems with specific suggestions
- Query logging enables future improvement tracking - systematic quality measurement vs ad-hoc testing

**What Could Improve:**
- Ragas metric interpretations for NL-to-SQL context needed clarification - "Faithfulness = schema consistency?" emerged during implementation
- Story 2.2 acceptance criteria ambiguous about "real calculation" vs "infrastructure" - led to placeholder v1.0
- Comparative report scope (Story 2.4) could have been clearer - what insights are "MVP" vs "nice-to-have"
- User-facing metric explanations minimal - Frontend shows scores but not what they mean

**Lessons Learned:**
- Explicit test data requirements prevent ambiguity - Story 2.4 uses known-weak queries (<0.7) for recommendation validation
- Integration checkpoints less critical in Epic 2 (fewer cross-story dependencies) but still valuable
- Senior Developer Review reveals hidden requirements - accessibility (ARIA, PropTypes), type hints, error boundaries
- Actionable recommendations require domain knowledge - generic "improve your prompt" less useful than "add few-shot example for salary comparisons"

- Demo script preparation highlighting Ragas evaluation as differentiator
- Stakeholder demo environment setup (clean database, representative queries pre-loaded)
- Documentation review - README, architecture diagrams, deployment guide

**Risk Assessment:**
- Railway deployment unknowns - environment variables, database migration execution, static file serving
- Demo might not show interesting score variations if all queries score high (need mix of good/weak queries)
- Interview panel may question placeholder aspects (Story 2.2 v1.0 findings if not fully addressed)

---

### Bob (Scrum Master)

**Dependencies Check:**
- Epic 002 stories at "Ready for Review" status - pending final approval before deployment ✅
- Technical debt documented across all stories - backlog ready for prioritization ✅
- Test suite comprehensive (130+ tests total) - ready for CI/CD pipeline ✅

**Preparation Needs:**
- Final review and approval of Stories 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 (currently Ready for Review)
- Address medium-priority review findings before production deployment
- Railway deployment execution (migrations, environment variables, health checks)
- Demo rehearsal with team to validate end-to-end flow

**Risk Assessment:**
- Deployment window undefined - timeline for Railway setup unknown
- Some stories have medium-priority action items unfixed (PropTypes, ARIA labels, type hints)
- No production monitoring/alerting configured - blind to issues after deployment

---

### Amelia (Developer Agent)

**Dependencies Check:**
- All Epic 002 code implemented and tested - clean deployment candidate ✅
- Database migrations ready (001, 002, 003) - sequential execution plan clear ✅
- Environment variables documented - .env.example includes Ragas requirements ✅

**Preparation Needs:**
- Execute Railway deployment (database provisioning, migrations, app deployment)
- Address medium-priority review findings (PropTypes, ARIA labels, type hints, real Ragas calls verification)
- Create deployment runbook (step-by-step Railway setup, rollback procedures)
- Test production environment end-to-end before demo

**Risk Assessment:**
- Railway platform-specific issues unknown - static file serving, PostgreSQL version compatibility, environment variable management
- Ragas library installation time (3-5 minutes on Windows per Story 2.1) may cause deployment delays
- Production database seeding strategy unclear - need representative employee data for demo

---

### Murat (Master Test Architect)

**Dependencies Check:**
- Test suite mature - 130+ tests across backend (70) and frontend (60+) ✅
- Integration test pattern established (Epic 1 Story 1.8) - reusable for deployment validation ✅
- Performance tests exist - response time <5s verified ✅

**Preparation Needs:**
- Smoke test suite for production deployment validation
- Load testing plan (optional - demo environment may not need)
- Test data strategy for demo - known-good and known-weak queries for Ragas demonstration
- Regression test execution before final deployment

**Risk Assessment:**
- No production monitoring tests - can't verify system health post-deployment
- Missing load tests with real Ragas overhead - production performance unknown
- Test data in production may differ from dev - seed data quality critical for demo

---

### Winston (Architect)

**Dependencies Check:**
- Architecture complete - modular monolith with evaluation layer integrated ✅
- Database schema finalized - employees + query_logs tables ready ✅
- Deployment model defined - Docker Compose (dev), Railway (production) ✅

**Preparation Needs:**
- Railway deployment architecture review (database tier, app tier, static file CDN?)
- Production environment configuration (connection pooling, timeout tuning, logging levels)
- Monitoring and observability setup (structured logs, health check endpoint, error tracking)
- Backup and recovery strategy for production database

**Risk Assessment:**
- Railway platform constraints unknown - connection pool limits, memory limits, egress costs
- Static file serving path resolution fragile (flagged in Epic 1 Story 1.8) - may break in Railway
- No disaster recovery plan - database backup/restore untested
- Ragas API costs in production environment unbudgeted (OpenAI embeddings per query)

---

### Mary (Business Analyst)

**Dependencies Check:**
- All business requirements satisfied - Epic 1 (query system) + Epic 2 (evaluation) complete ✅
- Success criteria met - NFR002 (<5s response), NFR004 (scores 0.7+ acceptable) ✅
- User journey complete - query → results → scores → recommendations ✅

**Preparation Needs:**
- Demo script with business value narrative (not just technical walkthrough)
- Representative query scenarios for demo - show green/yellow/red score variations
- Stakeholder presentation highlighting quality awareness differentiator
- User documentation (optional) - how to interpret Ragas scores

**Risk Assessment:**
- Demo may not showcase evaluation value if all queries score green (need intentionally weak queries)
- Interview panel may focus on gaps (placeholder scores, accessibility) rather than achievements
- Business value of Ragas evaluation unclear to non-technical stakeholders - need clear narrative
- Comparative reporting (Story 2.4) may be overlooked in demo - need to highlight actionable recommendations
