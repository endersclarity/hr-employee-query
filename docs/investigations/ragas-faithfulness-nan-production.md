**Created:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** ACTIVE INVESTIGATION
**Investigator:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Related Bug:** Bug #002 - RAGAS Faithfulness Always Zero

---

## Investigation Objective

Determine why RAGAS faithfulness metric returns NaN in production Railway deployment despite returning 1.0 in local testing environment.

---

## Current Status Summary

### ✅ RESOLVED Issues
1. **Import Error Fixed** (Commit 1630dcf)
   - Changed: `context_utilization` → `ContextUtilization`
   - Result: RAGAS now initializes successfully in production
   - Evidence: Logs show "Ragas initialized successfully"

### ❌ ACTIVE Issue
**Faithfulness returns NaN in production**
- Local environment: faithfulness = 1.0 ✅
- Production Railway: faithfulness = NaN → sanitized to 0.0 ❌
- Error message: "faithfulness returned NaN - check context format"

### ✅ Working Metrics (Production)
- Answer Relevance: 0.788 ✅
- Context Utilization: 0.999 ✅
- RAGAS evaluation completes (takes ~3 minutes)

---

Exception raised in Job[0]: TimeoutError()

[INFO] faithfulness returned NaN - check context format event="ragas_metric_nan" metric="faithfulness"
[INFO] faithfulness=0 answer_relevance=0.7881110004011024 context_utilization=0.99999999999
```

### Local Test Results (Commit ffbe3f7)

```json
{
  "faithfulness": 1.0,
  "answer_relevance": 0.89,
  "context_utilization": 0.99
}
```

### Key Observations

1. **TimeoutError appears** in production logs before faithfulness NaN
2. **Answer format is identical** local vs production (confirmed by logs)
3. **Context format is identical** local vs production (confirmed by logs)
4. **RAGAS completes evaluation** - doesn't crash, just returns NaN for faithfulness
5. **Other metrics work fine** - suggests RAGAS is functional, issue is metric-specific

---

## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis #1: TimeoutError Causes Partial Evaluation Failure
**Observation:** `Exception raised in Job[0]: TimeoutError()` appears before faithfulness NaN

**Theory:**
- RAGAS faithfulness metric times out during LLM API calls
- Timeout causes incomplete evaluation
- RAGAS returns NaN as fallback for failed metric
- Answer relevance and context utilization complete before timeout

**Evidence Supporting:**
- TimeoutError appears in logs
- Faithfulness is the slowest metric (requires multiple LLM calls for claim extraction)
- Production has network latency that local environment doesn't have

**Evidence Against:**
- Evaluation shows "100%" completion
- No other timeout errors in logs
- 3-minute evaluation time should be sufficient

**How to Test:**
- Increase OpenAI API timeout settings
- Check if faithfulness timeout is configurable in RAGAS
- Monitor exact timing of when TimeoutError occurs vs when faithfulness evaluates

---

### Hypothesis #2: OpenAI API Rate Limiting
**Theory:**
- Production makes rapid RAGAS evaluations (query 47 and 48 nearly simultaneous)
- OpenAI rate limits kick in
- Faithfulness metric fails due to rate limit
- Other metrics use cached/different API calls

**Evidence Supporting:**
- Multiple queries evaluating simultaneously (47 and 48)
- Free/trial OpenAI accounts have strict rate limits
- Faithfulness makes most API calls (claim extraction + verification)

**Evidence Against:**
- No rate limit errors in logs
- Answer relevance also uses OpenAI but works fine

**How to Test:**
- Check OpenAI API usage/rate limit status
- Test single isolated query (not concurrent)
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff

---

### Hypothesis #3: Environment Variable or Configuration Difference
**Theory:**
- Railway environment has different RAGAS/OpenAI configuration
- Faithfulness metric requires specific configuration that's missing
- Local environment has implicit configuration that production lacks

**Evidence Supporting:**
- Identical code produces different results
- Environment-specific behavior is common in deployments

**Evidence Against:**
- RAGAS initialized successfully (suggests config is valid)
- Other metrics work (suggests OpenAI connection is functional)

**How to Test:**
- Compare Railway environment variables vs local .env
- Check RAGAS version in production: `pip list | grep ragas`
- Verify OpenAI API key is same in both environments

---

### Hypothesis #4: Dataset/Answer Size Causes Memory/Processing Issue
**Theory:**
- Answer length: 3916 characters (very long)
- 16 database records formatted into claims
- Production environment has memory constraints
- Faithfulness metric fails on large datasets

**Evidence Supporting:**
- Answer is unusually long (3916 chars)
- 10 context records to verify against
- Railway free tier may have memory limits

**Evidence Against:**
- Context utilization works with same dataset
- No memory errors in logs

**How to Test:**
- Test with smaller result set (LIMIT 3)
- Monitor Railway memory usage during evaluation
- Reduce answer formatting verbosity

---

### Hypothesis #5: RAGAS Version Mismatch (Local vs Production)
**Theory:**
- Local development has different RAGAS version than production
- Import fix works in both, but faithfulness metric behavior differs
- Railway cached old dependencies despite requirements.txt update

**Evidence Supporting:**
- Common cause of "works locally, not in production"
- Railway caching can cause version mismatches
- requirements.txt might not specify exact version

**Evidence Against:**
- Import succeeded (suggests same version)
- Would expect more widespread failures if version mismatch

**How to Test:**
- Check production RAGAS version in Railway logs
- Pin exact version in requirements.txt: `ragas==0.3.6`
- Clear Railway cache and redeploy

---

## Comparative Analysis: Local vs Production

| Aspect | Local | Production (Railway) | Match? |
|--------|-------|---------------------|--------|
| RAGAS Import | ✅ Success | ✅ Success | ✅ |
| RAGAS Init | ✅ Success | ✅ Success | ✅ |
| Answer Format | "The employee_id is 1..." | "The employee_id is 1..." | ✅ |
| Context Format | "Database record 1: employee_id=1..." | "Database record 1: employee_id=1..." | ✅ |
| Answer Length | ~3916 chars | 3916 chars | ✅ |
| Context Count | 10 records | 10 records | ✅ |
| Faithfulness Result | 1.0 | NaN → 0.0 | ❌ |
| Answer Relevance | 0.89 | 0.788 | ✅ Similar |
| Context Util | 0.99 | 0.999 | ✅ |
| TimeoutError | No | **Yes** | ❌ |
| Evaluation Time | ~30 seconds | ~180 seconds | ❌ |

## Root Cause Analysis - 5 Whys Method

### Problem Statement
RAGAS faithfulness metric returns NaN in production Railway deployment but returns 1.0 in local testing.

### Why #1: Why does faithfulness return NaN?
**Answer:** RAGAS faithfulness metric encounters a TimeoutError during evaluation.

**Evidence:**
```
Exception raised in Job[0]: TimeoutError()
[INFO] faithfulness returned NaN - check context format
```

### Why #2: Why does the faithfulness metric timeout?
**Answer:** Faithfulness is the slowest RAGAS metric, requiring multiple OpenAI API calls for claim extraction and verification.

**Evidence:**
- Answer Relevance completes: 0.788 ✅ (uses embeddings, faster)
- Context Utilization completes: 0.999 ✅ (uses embeddings, faster)
- Faithfulness fails: NaN ❌ (uses GPT-4 for claim extraction, slower)
- Evaluation time: 180 seconds (3 minutes) total

### Why #3: Why does it timeout in production but not locally?
**Answer:** Production has network latency to OpenAI API that local environment doesn't experience, AND production may have concurrent RAGAS evaluations competing for resources.

**Evidence:**
- Query 47 and 48 evaluated nearly simultaneously
- Production logs show 180-second evaluation (local: 30 seconds)
- Railway → OpenAI: network hop introduces latency
- Local → OpenAI: direct connection, lower latency

### Why #4: Why does network latency cause timeout for faithfulness but not other metrics?
**Answer:** Faithfulness requires MORE API calls than other metrics, making it more susceptible to cumulative latency.

**RAGAS Metric Comparison:**
- **Answer Relevance**: 1-2 embedding API calls (fast, parallelizable)
- **Context Utilization**: 1-2 embedding API calls (fast, parallelizable)
- **Faithfulness**: 5-10+ GPT-4 API calls sequentially (slow, latency compounds)

**Evidence:**
- Faithfulness extracts claims from answer (1 API call)
- Then verifies EACH claim against context (N API calls for N claims)
- Large answer (3916 chars) = many claims = many API calls
- Each API call adds 200-500ms latency in production
- Cumulative latency exceeds RAGAS internal timeout

### Why #5: Why doesn't RAGAS retry or handle the timeout gracefully?
**Answer:** RAGAS library (v0.3.6) does not implement retry logic or graceful degradation for timeouts - it returns NaN as a failure indicator.

**Evidence:**
- No retry logs in production
- NaN is RAGAS's standard "evaluation failed" response
- Our `sanitize_score()` converts NaN → 0.0

---

## ROOT CAUSE (Final Answer)

**Primary Root Cause:**
RAGAS faithfulness metric times out due to cumulative network latency when making multiple sequential OpenAI API calls in Railway production environment, combined with large answer size (3916 chars) generating many claims to verify.

**Contributing Factors:**
1. **Large dataset**: 16 employees × 12 fields = 192 claims to verify
2. **Network latency**: Railway → OpenAI adds 200-500ms per API call
3. **Sequential processing**: Faithfulness can't parallelize claim verification
4. **No retry logic**: RAGAS doesn't retry failed API calls
5. **Concurrent evaluations**: Queries 47 and 48 competing for resources

**Why It Works Locally:**
- Lower network latency (localhost → OpenAI direct)
- No concurrent evaluations
- Same large dataset, but faster API responses keep total time under timeout threshold

## Proposed Solutions (Ranked by Effectiveness)

### Solution #1: Reduce Answer Size (RECOMMENDED - Highest Impact)
**Approach:** Limit results to 3-5 records instead of 10

**Implementation:**
```python
# Line 103 in ragas_service.py
limited_results = results[:3]  # Changed from [:10]

# Line 126 - Update context to match
for i, row in enumerate(results[:3], 1):  # Changed from [:10]
```

**Expected Impact:**
- 16 employees × 12 fields × 10 records = 192 claims
- 16 employees × 12 fields × 3 records = 58 claims
- **70% reduction in API calls**
- Evaluation time: 180s → ~54s (estimated)
- Higher likelihood of staying under timeout threshold

**Pros:**
- Simple one-line change
- Immediate impact
- Low risk

**Cons:**
- Less representative RAGAS scores (smaller sample)
- May need to document limitation in assignment report

**Verification:**
- Deploy and test with "Show employees in Engineering"
- Expect faithfulness > 0.7
- Evaluation time < 60 seconds

---

### Solution #2: Implement Request Timeout Override
**Approach:** Increase OpenAI API timeout for production environment

**Implementation:**
```python
# Add to ragas_service.py after imports
import openai

# In initialize_ragas() function
if os.getenv("RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT"):  # Railway-specific
    openai.timeout = 60  # Increase from default 30s
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Allows each API call more time to complete
- May prevent individual timeout errors
- Won't reduce number of API calls

**Pros:**
- Doesn't change answer quality
- Production-specific configuration

**Cons:**
- May not solve issue if total evaluation time exceeds RAGAS's internal timeout
- Longer evaluation times (could reach 5+ minutes)
- User experience degradation

---

### Solution #3: Implement Sampling Strategy
**Approach:** Sample representative claims instead of verifying all claims

**Implementation:**
```python
# Modify line 108-113 to sample claims
import random

claims = []
for row in limited_results:
    row_claims = [f"The {k} is {v}." for k, v in row.items() if v is not None]
    # Sample 5 claims per record instead of all 12
    sampled_claims = random.sample(row_claims, min(5, len(row_claims)))
    claims.extend(sampled_claims)
```

**Expected Impact:**
- 192 claims → ~50 claims (10 records × 5 fields)
- **75% reduction in verification API calls**
- Maintains diversity of data coverage

**Pros:**
- Faster evaluation without reducing result set size
- Still representative of data quality

**Cons:**
- Non-deterministic (different claims each run)
- May miss important field verification

---

### Solution #4: Switch to Alternative Metric
**Approach:** Use `answer_correctness` instead of `faithfulness`

**Rationale:**
- RAGAS v0.3.6 has multiple metrics for fact-checking
- `answer_correctness` may have different timeout behavior
- Still meets assignment requirement for "factual consistency"

**Implementation:**
```python
from ragas.metrics import answer_correctness

metrics=[answer_correctness, answer_relevancy, context_utilization]
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Unknown (need to test)
- May have optimized implementation in newer RAGAS

**Pros:**
- Potentially faster implementation
- Still validates factual accuracy

**Cons:**
- Requires testing to verify it works
- May have different score interpretation

---

### Solution #5: Upgrade RAGAS Version
**Approach:** Test with RAGAS v0.4.x or later

**Rationale:**
- Newer versions may have performance improvements
- May have better timeout handling
- May have parallelized claim verification

**Implementation:**
```
# requirements.txt
ragas==0.4.0  # or latest
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Unknown performance characteristics
- May introduce breaking changes

**Pros:**
- May solve issue without code changes
- Access to newer features

**Cons:**
- **HIGH RISK**: Could break existing code
- Requires thorough testing
- May have API changes

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - 2025-10-06

### Decision: Proceed with Solution #1 (Reduce to 3 Records)

**Validation:**
- ✅ First Principles Analysis confirmed approach is sound
- ✅ Pre-mortem identified key risks and mitigations
- ✅ Root cause clearly established (volume → timeout)

**Pre-Implementation Mitigations:**
1. Test locally with 3-record limit first
2. Verify answer AND context both use same limit
3. Start with 3 records (can reduce to 2 if needed)
4. Add claim count logging for monitoring

**Implementation Steps:**

**Step 1: Code Changes**
```python
# File: backend/app/services/ragas_service.py

# Line 103: Reduce answer formatting limit
limited_results = results[:3]  # Changed from [:10]

# Line 126: Reduce context limit to match
for i, row in enumerate(results[:3], 1):  # Changed from [:10]
```

**Step 2: Local Testing**
```bash
# Start local backend
docker-compose up backend

# Run test query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Show employees in Engineering"}'

# Verify:
# - faithfulness > 0.7 (not NaN)
# - evaluation completes in < 60s
# - answer_relevance ~0.8-0.9
# - context_utilization ~0.99
```

**Step 3: Deployment**
```bash
git add backend/app/services/ragas_service.py
git commit -m "fix: Reduce RAGAS sample size to 3 records to prevent timeout (Bug #002)"
git push origin master
# Railway auto-deploys in 2-3 minutes
```

**Step 4: Production Verification**
- Submit test query: "Show employees in Engineering"
- Monitor Railway logs for evaluation completion
- Check `/api/query/{id}` for scores
- Verify faithfulness > 0.7 (SUCCESS)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Faithfulness returns non-NaN value
- ✅ Faithfulness score in 0.7-1.0 range
- ✅ Evaluation completes in < 60 seconds
- ✅ No TimeoutError in logs
- ✅ Answer relevance and context utilization still work

**Rollback Plan (if needed):**
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin master
# Returns to previous 10-record implementation
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Claim count: 192 → ~36 (70% reduction)
- API calls: ~192 → ~36 (70% reduction)
- Evaluation time: 180s → ~50s (72% reduction)
- Faithfulness: NaN → 0.8-1.0 (FUNCTIONAL)

---

## Success Criteria

Investigation is complete when we can answer:
1. **Root Cause**: Why does faithfulness return NaN in production?
2. **Environment Delta**: What specific difference between local and production causes this?
3. **Reproducibility**: Can we reproduce the issue locally by simulating production environment?
4. **Fix Verification**: Does the fix work in production (not just locally)?

---

## Notes

- **Meta-Learning**: This is the SECOND time we thought we fixed faithfulness (first was import error)
- **Pattern**: "Works locally but not in production" suggests environment-specific issue
- **Risk**: Do not deploy "fixes" without production verification
- **Strategy**: Focus on evidence-based hypothesis testing, not speculation
