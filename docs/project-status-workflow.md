# Project Status & BMad Method Workflow

**Project:** Natural Language HR Employee Records Query Application
**Owner:** Kaelen
**Purpose:** Job interview demonstration (Presentation: October 12th, 2025)
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-01

---

## Quick Status

**Current Phase:** Phase 4 (Implementation) - Ready to Start

**Next Action:** Use Scrum Master agent to create detailed stories with story-context for Epic 1 (8 stories)

---

## Project Context

This is a **job interview demonstration project** where the goal is to:
1. Build a working end-to-end NL-to-SQL HR query application
2. Demonstrate ability to ship despite knowledge gaps
3. Use BMad Method to show structured thinking and planning
4. Deliver comprehensive project documentation

**Key Insight:** The interviewer is testing ability to execute systematically, not just technical perfection.

  - Supercharges dev with focused, relevant information

**How to Start:** Use SM agent, run `*story-context` workflow (auto after create-story)

#### 4.3 Development & Review
- **Status:** PENDING
- **Agent:** Dev Agent
- **Input:** Story + story-context
- **What it will do:**
  - Implement the story with supercharged context
  - Senior dev review (no separate QA agent in v6)

## MVP Requirements Summary

### Core Deliverables (From Assignment)

**Frontend (React):**
- Input box for natural language queries
- Submit button
- Results displayed in tabular format

**Backend (Python, FastAPI):**
- REST API accepting NL queries
- OpenAI/Anthropic integration (NL â†’ SQL conversion)
- Execute SQL against database
- Return JSON results

**Database (Relational - PostgreSQL or SQLite):**
- `employees` table with 11 fields:
  - employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, role
  - employment_status, hire_date, leave_type
  - salary_local, salary_usd, manager_name
- Mock HR data aligned with example queries

**Example Queries (Must Handle):**
1. "List employees hired in the last 6 months"
2. "Show employees in Engineering with salary greater than 120K"
3. "List employees on parental leave"
4. "Show employees managed by John Doe"

**Ragas Evaluation:**
- Faithfulness scores (0-1 scale, expect 0.7-1.0)
- Answer Relevance scores
- Context Precision scores
- Comparative results across multiple queries
- Documented recommendations for improvement

**Deployment:**
- Docker containers (frontend + backend)
- docker-compose.yml for local execution
- Cloud deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Secret management for API keys

**Documentation:**
- README (setup, deployment, usage)
- Project Report (architecture, flow, deployment)

### Critical Additions (From Pre-mortem Analysis)

**1. Mock Data Design Strategy:**
- Intentionally designed test dataset aligned with example queries
- Ensure "John Doe" exists as manager
- Ensure employees in each category (recent hires, Engineering >120K, parental leave)

**2. Security & Validation Layer:**
- SQL query validator (whitelist SELECT only)
- Input sanitization (block DELETE/DROP/UPDATE/INSERT)
- Rate limiting on API
- API key management documented
- Error handling for malicious queries

**3. Ragas Success Criteria:**
- Understand baseline expectations (0.9-1.0 = Excellent, 0.8-0.9 = Good)
- Document how to interpret metrics
- Create actionable recommendations (not generic)

**4. Testing & Validation Plan:**
- Test all 4 example queries before demo
- Identify and document 2-3 "weak spots"
- Create comparative results table
- Test edge cases

**5. Demo Day Preparation:**
- Visual architecture diagram
- Rehearse Ragas explanation
- Rehearse NLâ†’SQL prompt engineering choices
- Test cloud deployment 48+ hours before presentation
- Backup plan (screenshots/video if live demo fails)
- Practice answering: "How do you prevent SQL injection via natural language?"

**6. Enhanced Project Report:**
- System flow diagram (visual)
- Prompt engineering rationale section
- Ragas metrics interpretation guide
- Known limitations & weaknesses section
- Recommendations with specific, actionable improvements

âœ… **Provides documentation trail** for Project Report deliverable
âœ… **Demonstrates systematic thinking** (what interviewer is testing)
âœ… **Identifies risks early** (pre-mortem found critical gaps)
âœ… **Scales appropriately** (won't over-engineer a demo project)
âœ… **Story-driven development** (v6 story-context feature supercharges implementation)
